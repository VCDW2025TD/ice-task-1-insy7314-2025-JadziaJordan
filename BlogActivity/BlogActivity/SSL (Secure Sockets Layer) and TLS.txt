SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security)
SSL and TLS serve the same purpose: securing data during transmission over the internet. TLS is the newer, more secure version of SSL.

Main Functions of SSL/TLS:

Encryption: Protects data from being read by unauthorized parties.

Authentication: Confirms the identity of the communicating parties.

Data Integrity: Ensures that the data has not been tampered with during transmission.

HTTP vs HTTPS
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):

Data is transmitted in plain text.

Vulnerable to:

Eavesdropping (e.g., someone on the same Wi-Fi network can see your data)

Man-in-the-middle attacks (attackers intercept and modify data)

HTTPS (HTTP Secure):

Uses SSL/TLS to secure communication.

Provides:

Encryption: Data is unreadable to anyone who intercepts it.

Authentication: Websites present digital certificates to prove their identity (prevents spoofed or fake websites).

Data Integrity: Ensures the data hasnâ€™t been changed or injected with malicious code during transmission.

Risks of Not Using SSL/TLS
Data Interception: Sensitive information (like login credentials, personal messages, financial data) can be easily captured by attackers.

Impersonation Attacks: Without authentication, users can be tricked into interacting with fake websites.

Data Tampering: Attackers can alter or inject content into unencrypted traffic.
